## Search & Patch
Menu *"Edit/Patch program/Search & Patch"*

I've made it when was analyzing corrupted binary (memory dump) to fix broken imports. Format of the Search-and-Replace hex string is the same as in IDA "Binary Search" (menu *"Search/Sequence of bytes... Alt-B"*). Bytes marked by question mark '`?`' in replace sting be substituted by found values. You are will be asked for each replace confirmation.
